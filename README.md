An attempt to build a reader mode for any url with [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

While reader mode is built-in in pretty much all browsers, getting a reader mode sharable link is not possible. This project is an attempt to solve that problem.

The end goal is like to get a sharable url [like this](https://reader.tuananh.net/?url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124201/bill-simmons-the-ringer-spotify-acquistion-podcast-purchase)

```
https://reader.tuananh.net/?url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124201/bill-simmons-the-ringer-spotify-acquistion-podcast-purchase
```

Upon navigating to the above url, it will render the target domain in reader mode.

## Features

* Get a pretty, sharable reader mode url.
* Bypass subscription.
* Cached by Cloudflare.
* Respect OS prefer color scheme (dark mode).
* Minimal CSS.
* Return JSON if request `Content-Type` is `application/json`. Effectively become an API to extract text.

## TODO

* [x] Dark mode.
* [x] Use a more lightweight css framework instead of milligram.
* [ ] Let user manually override preferred color scheme.

## Usage

You can setup a bookmarklet to use this.

```
javascript:(function()%7Bwindow.open('https%3A%2F%2Freader.tuananh.net%2F%3Furl%3D'%2Bwindow.location.href%2C%20'_blank')%7D)()
```
